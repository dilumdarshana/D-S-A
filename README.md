# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Major problem solving patterns collection and Data Structures

## How to run
```
npx ts-node algorithms/linked-list/ts/list.ts

python algorithms/linked-list/python/list.py
```

## Differece between DFS and BFS

- DFS - Goes to the depth by nodes. Use Stack to implement this.
- BFS - Goes level by level. Use Queue to implement this.

## Time complexity comparison
